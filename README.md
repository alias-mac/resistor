# Resistor Calculator [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/alias-mac/resistor.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/alias-mac/resistor) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/alias-mac/resistor/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/alias-mac/resistor?branch=master)

This is project was created to upgrade some really old code to calculate resistors that I had based on the book [JavaScript Bible](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/852391.JavaScript_Bible).

Using modern technologies such as [React][ReactJS], [Webpack][Webpack] and [Jest][Jest] I decided to dedicate some time to migrate the code and learn more about them.

If you want to have fun, you can see the original version of the app from the book [here](http://www.dannyg.com/examples/res2/resistor.htm).
